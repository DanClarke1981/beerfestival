				            <p><b>ABV 3.5%</b></p>
				            <p>Steerage passengers paid the least to travel aboard the Titanic but still found themselves surrounded by luxury they could never have dreamed of. This beer embodies the opulence that using only the finest ingredients brings, sit back relax and enjoy the trip that this refreshing clean drinking, hoppy golden bitter brings, then let the fruit, malt and predominantly hops carry through to the aftertaste.</p>
